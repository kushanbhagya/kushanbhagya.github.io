        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Kushan Bhagya, and I was born in 1999 and am from Kandy, Sri Lanka. My family consists of five members. As the family's eldest child, I had a younger sister and brother. My father, Susantha Premalal, works at Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals LTD - Muthurajawela Terminal. My mother, Priyanka Disanayake, is a housewife. My sister Heshani Bhagya is studying in school and she is appearing for A/L exam this year. Also my younger brother Oshan Bhagya is still going to school and he is studying in grade 10. My school is Dharmaraja College Kandy. I passed my Advanced level in the year 2018 from the physical science scheme and I am currently pursuing a Cyber Security degree at the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology for my higher education. A final year student at SLIIT, I started my career as an intern Information Security Analyst at Mobitel (Pvt) Ltd and am still working there.

Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my multitasking and task prioritization skills to a high degree. I approach problem-solving with a creative and original mindset, allowing me to tackle new challenges with ease. Upholding honesty, integrity, and a commitment to producing work of exceptional quality are principles that I hold dear. I firmly believe that humor, when coupled with a motivated attitude, can be a powerful tool in various situations.

As an undergraduate student, I actively sought leadership roles within project teams, recognizing the immense value of teamwork and collaboration. These experiences not only fueled my enthusiasm for technology but also served as a catalyst for continuous skill development. My professional journey commenced in 2023 as an Information Security Analyst intern at Mobitel (Pvt) Ltd, where I now proudly hold a permanent position alongside my ongoing education.

Driven by my passion for leveraging technology to foster creativity and engineer lasting solutions, I am deeply motivated to make a significant impact in the realm of Information Security. My ultimate goal is personal and professional growth, and I am always on the lookout for new opportunities to further expand my knowledge and talents.
